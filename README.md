# Flappy-Bird
Developed a Flappy Bird game using Java and Swing(GUI).
The game features a bird(square) that the player can control to navigate through columns/bars, earning points for passing through each gap.
The game dynamically welcomes player to start, addresses them personally, and celebrates their takeover upon achieving a high score.
Tried to create an immersive gaming experience.
